# Asteroids

This is for an exam given to me

To create a powerup, go to GameObject, create powerup.

We need to add manually update the list in the following ScriptableObjects
BarrierManagerSettings
WeaponManagerSettings
PowerupSettings

We also need to manually adjust sprite and size for the prefab variants created


Prefabs and Scriptableobjects are located in Assets/Project/Prefabs and Assets/Project/Settings
