# Asteroids

This is for an exam given to me

To create a powerup, go to GameObject, create powerup.
and from there we need to edit the prefabs and scriptableobjects created.

(RAN OUT OF TIME)
Scripts are not included so we should create a WeaponScript that inherits BaseWeapon and BarrierScript that inherits BaseBarrier. see examples (barrierbasic and weaponblaster)
