# Asteroids

This is for an exam given to me

To create a powerup, go to GameObject, create powerup.

We need to add manually update the list in the following ScriptableObjects
- BarrierManagerSettings
- WeaponManagerSettings
- PowerupSettings

We also need to manually adjust sprite and size for the prefab variants created


Prefabs and Scriptableobjects are located in Assets/Project/Prefabs and Assets/Project/Settings
