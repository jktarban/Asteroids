# Asteroids

This is for an exam given to me


I have ran out of time to implement editor script that automatically creates scripts, scriptable objects and prefabs. Also ran out of time to improve Asset Sprites

Configurations are located at Projects>Settings>

Creating a new weapon needs to create a new prefab, a weapon script, and a weapon scriptable object and add to the weapon manager settings. 
Same for Barrier and Powerups

Base prefabs are also there to create variants and configure
