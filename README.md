# Asteroids

This is for an exam given to me


I have ran out of time to implement editor script that automatically creates scripts, scriptable objects and prefabs when creating a new powerup. Also ran out of time to improve Asset Sprites

Configurations are located at Projects>Settings>

Creating a new weapon needs to create a new prefab, a weapon script, and a weapon scriptable object and add to the weapon manager settings. 
Same for Barrier and Powerups

Base prefabs are also there to create variants and configure
