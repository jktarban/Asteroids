# Asteroids

This is for an exam given to me

To create a powerup, go to GameObject, create powerup.
and from there we need to edit the prefabs and scriptableobjects created located in Assets/Project/Prefabs and Assets/Project/Settings

We need to add manually update the list in the following ScriptableObjects
BarrierManagerSettings
WeaponManagerSettings
PowerupSettings

We also need to manually adjust sprite and size for the prefab variants created
